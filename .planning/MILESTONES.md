# Project Milestones: AI Models Benchmark Analysis 2026

## v1 (Shipped: 2026-01-19)

**Delivered:** A comprehensive exploratory data analysis of the 2026 AI Models Benchmark Dataset (188 models) that discovers and publishes novel insights about AI model performance, pricing strategies, and market trends as a Kaggle notebook.

**Phases completed:** 1-4 (19 plans total)

**Key accomplishments:**

- Discovered 5 novel insights: Market bifurcation (Budget vs Premium segments), Pareto sparsity (4.4% efficient), Speed-intelligence decoupling (weak correlation), Regional asymmetry (Europe fastest but cheapest), Context window scaling (logarithmic growth)
- Built complete data pipeline with Polars LazyFrames and checkpointing (12,876 lines of Python)
- Performed rigorous statistical analysis with non-parametric methods, bootstrap CIs, and FDR correction
- Created 21 interactive Plotly visualizations (histograms, box plots, Pareto frontiers, tradeoff zones)
- Delivered publication-ready Kaggle notebook with narrative-driven analysis and comprehensive README

**Stats:**

- 63 files created/modified (data, reports, figures)
- 12,876 lines of Python
- 4 phases, 19 plans, 51 requirements
- 1 day from start to ship (2026-01-18 17:48 → 2026-01-18 20:27)

**Git range:** `feat(01-01)` → `feat(04-03)`

**What's next:** Future milestones could add advanced ML predictions, real-time dashboards, or multi-language support. See v2 requirements in archive.
