<objective>
Create executive summary and data quality foundation sections for Kaggle notebook

Purpose: Establish insight-first narrative structure (NARR-01) and setup data loading without code-first approach (ARCH-06)
Output: Notebook foundation with executive summary hook and data quality section

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create Jupyter notebook with executive summary</name>
  <files>ai_models_benchmark_analysis.ipynb</files>
  <action>
    Create new Jupyter notebook at project root with the structure:

    **Section 1: Executive Summary (First thing readers see, before any code)**

    Markdown cell with:
    - Hook: "What if you could identify the best AI model for your use case in minutes, not days?"
    - 3-5 key insights bullet points:
      * "Intelligence correlates moderately with price (ρ=0.590), but value champions exist"
      * "Only 8 models (4.4%) are Pareto-efficient for price-performance"
      * "Market has split into Budget (24 providers) vs Premium (12 providers) segments"
      * "All 10 pairwise correlations significant - no null findings in dataset"
      * "Regional differences: Europe fastest (142 token/s), US most expensive ($1.53)"
    - Brief methodology note: "Analysis of 187 AI models across 37 providers using non-parametric statistics"
    - Navigation: "Jump to: [Data Quality] | [Correlations] | [Pareto Frontiers] | [Provider Analysis] | [Conclusions]"

    Notebook metadata:
    - Title: "AI Models Benchmark 2026: A Data-Driven Analysis of Performance, Price, and Tradeoffs"
    - Kaggle-compatible format (no absolute paths, relative to working directory)
  </action>
  <verify>
    Notebook file exists with executive summary as first cell, contains 3-5 insight bullets with navigation links
  </verify>
  <done>Executive summary leads with insights, not code (NARR-01 satisfied)</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add data quality section with narrative (not code dump)</name>
  <files>ai_models_benchmark_analysis.ipynb</files>
  <action>
    Add "Data Quality Assessment" section after executive summary:

    **Markdown cells (narrative):**
    - Section header: "## 1. Data Quality Assessment"
    - Context: "Before diving into insights, let's establish trust in our data foundation"
    - Quality score callout: "**Overall Quality Score: 75%** (3/4 dimensions passed)"
    - Key findings table:
      * 187 models after deduplication (34 duplicate names resolved)
      * 96.81% completeness (only 6 null values in intelligence_index)
      * 37 providers across US, China, Europe, and other regions
      * All numerical variables right-skewed (validated non-parametric approach)
    - Data quality note: "10 models (5.32%) flagged as outliers but preserved for analysis"
    - Link to detailed report: "See [full quality assessment](reports/quality_2026-01-18.md) for complete analysis"

    **Code cell (minimal, imports from modules):**
    ```python
    import sys
    sys.path.append('.')
    from src.load import load_cleaned_data
    import polars as pl

    # Load deduplicated dataset
    df = load_cleaned_data("data/processed/ai_models_deduped.parquet")
    print(f"Loaded {df.height} models from {df['Creator'].n_unique()} providers")
    ```

    **Markdown cell (interpretation):**
    - "What this means: Our analysis is based on a clean, validated dataset with minimal missing values"
    - "Methodology choice: Due to right-skewed distributions, we use Spearman correlation (non-parametric) throughout"
  </action>
  <verify>
    Notebook has data quality section with markdown narrative, single code cell importing from src module, and interpretation cell
  </verify>
  <done>Data quality section uses ARCH-06 pattern (imports from modules), 2:1 markdown-to-code ratio</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Add setup and imports section (minimal code, well-documented)</name>
  <files>ai_models_benchmark_analysis.ipynb</files>
  <action>
    Add "Setup" section after data quality (or as first code cell if preferred):

    **Markdown cell:**
    - Section header: "## Setup"
    - Brief note: "This notebook imports pre-computed visualizations and analysis from our modular pipeline. No duplicate code - everything comes from src/ modules and pre-generated reports."

    **Code cell:**
    ```python
    # Core dependencies
    import polars as pl
    import numpy as np
    import sys
    sys.path.append('.')

    # Import analysis modules (script-as-module pattern)
    from src.load import load_cleaned_data
    from src.analyze import compute_summary_statistics
    from src.statistics import compute_spearman_correlation
    from src.pareto import get_pareto_efficient_models
    from src.clustering import aggregate_by_provider
    from src.bootstrap import bootstrap_mean_ci

    # Visualization helpers
    from IPython.display import IFrame, HTML, Markdown

    # Load data
    df = load_cleaned_data("data/processed/ai_models_deduped.parquet")

    print(f"✓ Loaded {df.height} models")
    print(f"✓ {df['Creator'].n_unique()} providers represented")
    print(f"✓ Analysis modules ready")
    ```

    **Markdown cell:**
    - "Notebook structure: All analysis logic lives in [src/](src/) modules for reproducibility"
    - "Visualizations are pre-generated for fast loading - see [reports/figures/](reports/figures/)"
  </action>
  <verify>
    Setup section imports from src/ modules (not inline logic), loads deduplicated data, prints confirmation
  </verify>
  <done>ARCH-06 satisfied: Notebook imports from scripts, no duplicate analysis logic</done>
</task>

</tasks>

After completing this plan:
- [ ] Notebook exists with executive summary FIRST (before any code)
- [ ] Executive summary has 3-5 key insights from statistical analysis
- [ ] Data quality section has narrative explanation + minimal code cell
- [ ] Setup section imports from src/ modules (not inline logic)
- [ ] Markdown cells outnumber code cells (roughly 2:1 ratio)
- [ ] Navigation links in executive summary work (can validate after later sections)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
1. Notebook file created at project root (ai_models_benchmark_analysis.ipynb)
2. Executive summary leads with insights, not code (NARR-01)
3. Story structure begins: hook (executive summary) → exploration (data quality)
4. Code imports from src/ modules (ARCH-06)
5. Markdown-to-code ratio ~2:1 in created sections
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/04-narrative-synthesis-publication/04-01-SUMMARY.md`
