    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "**What if you could identify the best AI model for your use case in minutes, not days?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook analyzes 187 AI models across 37 providers to uncover pricing patterns, performance correlations, and market dynamics that can inform your model selection strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Intelligence correlates moderately with price (ρ=0.590), but value champions exist** - You don't always need to pay premium prices for high intelligence. Budget-friendly models like DeepSeek V3.2 (IQ=41, $0.32) and GLM-4.7 (IQ=42, $0.94) offer competitive intelligence at a fraction of the cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Only 8 models (4.4%) are Pareto-efficient for price-performance** - These models represent the \"efficient frontier\" where no other model offers higher intelligence at a lower price. The rest are either dominated by more capable models or overpriced for their performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Market has split into Budget (24 providers) vs Premium (12 providers) segments** - K-means clustering reveals two distinct market segments: Budget providers ($0.35, IQ=17.9) and Premium providers ($1.53, IQ=29.0) with 4x price difference and 62% intelligence gap.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **All 10 pairwise correlations significant - no null findings in dataset** - Every relationship between variables (Intelligence-Price, Speed-Latency, etc.) is statistically significant after FDR correction, suggesting a highly interconnected market with consistent pricing patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Regional differences: Europe fastest (142 token/s), US most expensive ($1.53)** - European models prioritize speed (142.3 tokens/s) while US commands premium pricing ($1.53). Chinese models offer middle-ground pricing ($0.93) with competitive intelligence (22.2).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis of 187 AI models across 37 providers using non-parametric statistics (Spearman correlation, Mann-Whitney U tests, bootstrap CIs). All visualizations are pre-generated for fast loading. Analysis code is modularized in `src/` for reproducibility.\n",
